    ],
    "supply_chain": "Increased EV adoption in Nigeria may indirectly boost demand for energy storage components (batteries) and potentially solar PV for charging, but the impact on the global upstream supply chain is likely minimal in the short term due to the market's current scale.",
    "nigeria_impact": "Positive. The rise in EVs will increase electricity demand and highlight the need for reliable, clean power. This strengthens the business case for distributed solar and microgrid projects, which can provide cost-effective and resilient charging solutions, especially for commercial fleets and in off-grid/weak-grid areas.",
    "recommendation": "Monitor the Nigerian EV and charging infrastructure market closely. Consider pilot projects that bundle solar PV, battery storage, and EV charging for commercial and industrial clients. Prioritize partnerships with local firms experienced in energy and mobility."
