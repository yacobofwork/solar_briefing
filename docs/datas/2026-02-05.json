In a typical market, prices would diverge based on company-specific performance and sector trends.</p>\n        \n        <h3>Key Drivers</h3>\n        <p>Assuming accurate data, identical pricing across diverse firms would indicate a massive, synchronized market shock or a systemic data failure. Real-world drivers would include raw material costs (polysilicon, lithium), policy shifts (tariffs, incentives), technological breakthroughs, and broader equity market volatility.</p>\n        \n        <h3>Impact on Procurement</h3>\n        <p>Unreliable price data prevents concrete procurement analysis. Generally, stable or falling module and battery pack manufacturer equity prices can signal lower future component costs and improved supply, favoring project economics. Buyers should seek verified cost data from equipment suppliers, not equity markets, for procurement decisions.</p>\n        ",
