      "This massive domestic buildout secures economies of scale, further strengthening China's position in the global clean energy supply chain."
    ],
    "supply_chain": "China's massive domestic buildout reinforces its economies of scale in manufacturing, likely maintaining its position as the low-cost, high-volume supplier of solar modules and wind components to the global market. It may divert some production capacity to meet domestic targets, potentially tightening availability for exports in the short term.",
    "nigeria_impact": "Indirect impact. China's scale keeps global module prices competitive, which is beneficial for Nigerian project economics. However, focus on large-scale domestic projects may not directly address the specific needs (e.g., product specifications, financing) of Nigeria's distributed and microgrid sector.",
    "recommendation": "Procurement teams should monitor potential short-term supply tightness for specific components as Chinese demand peaks, but the long-term outlook remains favorable for low-cost equipment. Diversify supplier relationships within China and consider locking in contracts ahead of anticipated domestic installation surges."
