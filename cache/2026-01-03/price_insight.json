"<h2>Price Impact Analysis</h2>\n        <h3>Market Overview</h3>\n        <p>The provided data shows identical, extremely high share prices for TSLA and JKS, which is inconsistent with actual market values and suggests a significant data error. No meaningful change data is available.</p >\n        \n        <h3>Key Drivers</h3>\n        <p>The primary driver is erroneous data formatting or sourcing. In a real scenario, key drivers would include raw material costs (polysilicon, lithium), manufacturing capacity, trade policy, interest rates, and corporate earnings for solar and battery companies.</p >\n        \n        <h3>Impact on Procurement</h3>\n        <p>With unreliable price data, no specific procurement implications can be drawn. Generally, stable or declining equity prices for manufacturers can signal reduced component costs or oversupply, potentially benefiting system procurement. Volatility indicates supply chain risk.</p >\n        "
